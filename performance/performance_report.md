Date: June 6, 2025

## Test Configuration
- **Duration**: 30 seconds
- **Stages**: 
  - Ramp-up: 10s (0 to 5 VUs)
  - Steady state: 10s (5 VUs)
  - Ramp-down: 10s (5 to 0 VUs)
- **Target API**: JSONPlaceholder API
- **Endpoint**: GET /posts/1

## Key Performance Metrics

### Response Time Analysis
- **Average**: 76.85ms
- **Median**: 73.56ms
- **90th Percentile**: 88.81ms
- **95th Percentile**: 99.03ms
- **Min**: 64.58ms
- **Max**: 119.81ms

### Detailed Percentile Analysis
#### 90th Percentile (P90) - 88.81ms
- 90% of all requests completed within 88.81ms
- This indicates good performance for most users
- Only 10% of requests took longer than this threshold
- Well within acceptable range for API response times

#### 95th Percentile (P95) - 99.03ms
- 95% of requests completed within 99.03ms
- Represents worst-case scenarios for normal operations
- Shows excellent stability as it's still under 100ms
- Indicates minimal performance outliers

### Test Volume
- Total Requests: 98
- Request Rate: 3.23 requests/second
- Total Checks: 196
- Check Rate: 6.47 checks/second

### Success Metrics
- **HTTP Request Success Rate**: 100%
- **Check Success Rate**: 100%
- **Failed Requests**: 0%

## Performance Thresholds Status
All performance thresholds were met:
- ✅ Response time < 500ms
- ✅ HTTP 200 status code
- ✅ No failed requests

## Recommendations
1. The system shows excellent stability with response times consistently under 100ms
2. Current load (5 VUs) is well handled by the system
3. Consider testing with higher load to find performance limits
4. Monitor 95th percentile as it shows slight increase in response time

## Conclusions
- The system demonstrates robust performance under the tested load
- No performance degradation observed during the test duration
- Response times are consistent with low variance
- The application meets all defined performance criteria
